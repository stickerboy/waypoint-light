# Waypoint light
**A customised light theme for the Halo Waypoint forums**

Surfaces some elements of the Discourse forums that are currently hidden on Waypoint and enhances some existing features:
- “OP” badge to denote topic poster on their posts
- “Highlighted” badge to denote a post has been specifically highlighted
- Better highlighting for ‘closed’ topics
- Better highlighting for ‘read’ topic
- Better visibility of topic age within posts (like if a topic has gone 6 months without reply)
- Improved layouts of some sections using CSS grid
- Pushed more sections to fill the width of their containers, which looks a little neater
- Spaced out posts within topics
- User of border to stylize and visually separate content
