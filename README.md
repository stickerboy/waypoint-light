# Waypoint light
**A customised light theme for the Halo Waypoint forums**

Surfaces some elements of the Discourse forums that are currently hidden on Waypoint and enhances some existing features:
- Added back the “OP” badge to denote topic poster on their posts
- “Highlighted” badge to denote a post has been specifically highlighted
- Better highlighting for ‘closed’ topics
- Better highlighting for ‘read’ topics
- Made use of borders to stylize and visually separate content,
- Spaced out posts within topics
- Better visibility of topic age within posts (e.g. if a topic has gone 6 months without reply)
- Improved layouts of some sections using grids
- Pushed more sections to fill the width of their containers, which helps them to look a little neater
